Please download a working version from http://fabulouspanda.co.uk/guiminer.app.zip
and let me know if your hash rate improves or you have any issues with this version!

So all the GUIMiners on Mac can get stratum support without cmd line installation of 
the dependencies.

Like the last one, you'll need to force quit when you're done.

if it helps you out feel free to throw a bit my way ;)
